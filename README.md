# Workhorse

This is a chrome extension for converting data from one format to another. 
Developers usually use online tools, like https://jsonlint.com/.
It suppports a range of formats, like JSON, XML, YAML and more. 

The ultimate goal is to allow developers to create their own pipelines, import/export them freely.

## How can I help
We need to support more and more converters to match the ones provided by the online websites, such as [onlinetools](https://onlinetools.com/).
